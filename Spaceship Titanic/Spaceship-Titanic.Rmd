This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
trainingData <- read.csv('spaceship-titanic/train.csv')
trainingData
```

```{r}
shape <- dim(trainingData)
print(shape)
```

The training data has 14 columns with 8693 entries.

```{r}
summary_stats <- summary(trainingData)
print(summary_stats)
```

```{r}
head(trainingData)
```

```{r}
str(trainingData)
```

```{r}
#trainingData$Transported
table(trainingData$Transported)
```

```{r}
x_labels <- factor(trainingData$Transported, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE))
#xlabels <- (FALSE TRUE)
bar_colors <- c("red","blue")
y_values <- table(trainingData$Transported)
#barplot(y_values, col = bar_colors)
# Add labels to the bars
text(x = barplot(y_values, col = bar_colors), y = y_values, labels = y_values, pos = 3, cex = 0.8)
```

I wasn't able to make a satisfactory bar chart and googling a lot just started to get confusing. The chart does show slightly more TRUE than FALSE.
