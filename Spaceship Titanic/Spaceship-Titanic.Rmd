This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
trainingData <- read.csv('spaceship-titanic/train.csv')
trainingData
```

```{r}
shape <- dim(trainingData)
print(shape)
```

The training data has 14 columns with 8693 entries.

```{r}
summary_stats <- summary(trainingData)
print(summary_stats)
```

```{r}
head(trainingData)
```

```{r}
str(trainingData)
```

```{r}
#trainingData$Transported
table(trainingData[['Transported']])
```

```{r}
x_labels <- factor(trainingData$Transported, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE))
#xlabels <- (FALSE TRUE)
bar_colors <- c("red","blue")
y_values <- table(trainingData$Transported)
#barplot(y_values, col = bar_colors)
# Add labels to the bars
text(x = barplot(y_values, col = bar_colors), y = y_values, labels = y_values, pos = 3, cex = 0.8)
```

I wasn't able to make a satisfactory bar chart and googling a lot just started to get confusing. The chart does show slightly more TRUE than FALSE.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)


```

```{r}
ggplot(trainingData, aes(x = FoodCourt)) + geom_histogram(fill = 'blue', bins = 50)
```

```{r}
ggplot(trainingData, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram(fill = 'blue', bins = 50)
```

```{r}
ggplot(trainingData, aes(x = ShoppingMall
```

```{r}
ggplot(trainingData, aes(x = Spa)) + geom_histogram(fill = 'blue', bins = 50)
```

```{r}
ggplot(trainingData, aes(x = VRDeck)) + geom_histogram(fill = 'blue', bins = 50)
```

```{r}
# calculate the number of missing values in each column
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(trainingData))

# sort missing values in descending order
sorted_missing_values <- sort(missing_values, decreasing = TRUE)

print(sorted_missing_values)
```

```{r}
#trainingData[['Cabin']]
summary(trainingData[['Cabin']])
```

```{r}
summary(trainingData[['Age']])
```

```{r}
summary(trainingData[['VIP']])
#trainingData[['VIP']]
```

```{r}
summary(trainingData[['Transported']])
```

```{Transported is character data instead of logical. This needs to be corrected.}
```

```{r}
trainingData$Transported <- as.logical(trainingData$Transported == "True")
summary(trainingData[['Transported']])
#trainingData[['Transported']]
```

```{r}
transported <- suppressWarnings({trainingData %>%
  group_by(Transported) %>%
  summarise_all(list(mean = mean, sd = sd, min = min, max = max))})
print(transported)
```

```{r}
mean_age <- mean(trainingData[['Age']], na.rm = TRUE)
mean_age
```

```{r}
transported_df <- trainingData[trainingData$Transported == TRUE,]
not_transported_df <- trainingData[trainingData$Transported == FALSE,]
```

```{r}
mean_age_transported <- mean(transported_df$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_age_not_transported <- mean(not_transported_df$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
mean_age_transported
```

```{r}
mean_age_not_transported
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

            Mean_Spa = mean(Spa, na.rm = TRUE),
            Mean_VR = mean(VRDeck, na.rm = TRUE),
