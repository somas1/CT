## Functions and Conditionals

### Conditionals

The basic syntax for an if statement goes like this:

```{r}
if (logical statement) {
  do something
} else {
  do something else
}
```

The logical statements should boil down to a boolean; for example:

```{r}
a <- 10
if (a <= 5) {
  print(a)
} else {
  print("It's more than 5")
}
```

We can also add else if statements in the middle if we need more options.

```{r}
a <- 15
if (a <= 5) {
  print("small")
} else if (a > 5 & a <= 10) {
  print("medium")
} else if (a > 10 | a == 7) {
  print("large")
} else {
  print("huge")
}
```

Neat! We can also nest conditionals just like we do in Python.

```{r}
a <- 5
if (a / 2 != 0) {
  if (a == 5) {
    print("a is 5")
  }
}
```

Neat! Now, let's look at another core part of R programming - Loops!

### Loops

```{r}
for (value in 1:5) {
  # Paste is a concatenation function
  print(paste(value, "is greater than", value - 1))
}
```

We can also do nifty stuff with our vectors, such as apply changes to specific indices of our data.

```{r}
a_vector <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
# Change the first, third and sixth elements to the value 6
for (i in c(1,3,6)){
  a_vector[i] <- 6
}

a_vector
```

We can loop over more than just lists:

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

for (row in 1:2){
  for (col in 1:2){
    mat[row, col] <- 0
    print(mat)
  }
}
```

Like Python, we have while loops in R:

```{r}
b <- 0
while (b < 10){
  # increase b by 2
  b <- b + 2
  # print b
  print(b)
}
```

## Functions

When should we use functions?

```{r}
our_function <- function(optional_params){
  # do some stuff
}
```

An example:

```{r}
# Start with a vector of temperatures
test_temp <- c(16.550540, 26.942005, 32.591088, 8.580116, 28.003873, 28.542391, 20.976820, 21.173577, 21.048836, 18.769735)

# function that converts from C to F
c_to_f <- function(dat){
  temp_fahr <- dat*(9/5) + 32
  
  return(temp_fahr)
}

print(c_to_f(26))
```

This is all cool.. but it didn't do anything. We need to call the function!

```{r}
data_fahr <- c_to_f(test_temp)
data_fahr
```

Notice that in the background here, we are looping over each item in the array, but we never write a for loop! Keep this in mind, since when you pass in a large data set, the changes made by functions aren't quite immediate - the computer does have to go over each item in your data set, and change them one at a time.

A shortcut of sorts is to use the `apply()` function, which operates very similarly to Python's `map()`. Note that `apply` syntax goes as follows: `apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)` where X is the data set to use, MARGIN is specification for rows or columns, and FUN is the function to apply.

```{r}
test_mat <- matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2), nrow <- 2)
test_mat
```

```{r}
apply(test_mat, 1, sum)
```

```{r}
# 1 above is for rows. 2 below is for columns
apply(test_mat, 2, sum)
```

It is common to use `mean`, `median`, `sum`, `min`, or `max` with `apply`, but we can also use our user-defined functions as well. Note that apply() only works with matrices.

```{r}
test_temp_mat <- matrix(c(16.550540, 26.942005, 32.591088, 8.580116, 28.003873, 28.542391, 20.976820, 21.173577, 21.048836, 18.769735), nrow = 2)

apply(test_temp_mat, 1, c_to_f)
```

### Homework

1.  Do 5 CodeWars problems in R. Share your solutions here:

    ```{r}
    # In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
    # https://www.codewars.com/kata/554b4ac871d6813a03000035/train/r
    high_and_low <- function(numbers){
     split <- strsplit(numbers, split = " ")
      
      sorted <- sort(as.numeric(unlist(split)))
      
      max <- sorted[length(sorted)]
      min <- sorted[1]
      
      return (paste(max,min))
    }

    #'Example tests'
    high_and_low("8 3 -5 42 -1 0 0 -9 4 7 4 -4") == "42 -9"
    high_and_low("1 2 3") == "3 1"
    ```

    ```{r}

    ```

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  Create a function that checks an input of type `int` and returns fizz if the number is a multiple of 3, buzz if the number is a multiple of 5, and fizzbuzz if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5.

    ```{r}

    ```

3.  **Mario Challenge:** In the classic Super Mario games, Mario ends each level by ascending a flight of stairs and leaping off the top to arrive at the castle at the end. (See [here](https://youtu.be/-avspZlbOWU?t=55) for details). We can imagine that each of the bricks of the stairs is a character X. Create a function that prints out a set of stairs. For example:

    If the function is called marioStairs() and we pass in the value 4, we would expect to see stairs with a length of 4 and a height of 4:

    X

    XX

    XXX

    XXXX

    ```{r}
    # You may feel more comfortable figuring this out in Python first, then translating into R later.
    ```
